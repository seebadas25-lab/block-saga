## 🎮 Game Description

**Block Saga** is a strategic block puzzle game where your goal is to clear lines and achieve high scores. Unlike traditional block games, pieces do not fall; instead, you drag and drop them onto the board.

### Key Rules
1.  **Drag & Drop**: Pick one of the 3 available blocks from the bottom tray and place it on the 8x8 grid.
2.  **Clear Lines**: Fill an entire row or column to clear blocks and earn points.
3.  **No Rotation**: Blocks cannot be rotated. You must think ahead and fit them as they are.
4.  **Game Over**: The game ends instantly if you cannot place any of the remaining blocks.
